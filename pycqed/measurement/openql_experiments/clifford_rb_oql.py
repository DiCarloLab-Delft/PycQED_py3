    Two-qubit character benchmarking:
        q0: P - C1 - C2 - C3 - ... - Cn- R - M
        q1: P - C1 - C2 - C3 - ... - Cn- R - M
    P -> Single qubit Pauli's. Single qubit Paulis are chosen so as to
        prepare in |00>, |01>, |10> and |11>.
        N.B. data should be averaged over all single qubit Paulis.
    Ci -> Single qubit Cliffords, different seqs for both qubits.
    R -> Recovery Clifford so that seq of C1 - Cn correspond to Idx.
    M -> Measurement in Z-basis.

    Outcomes should be averaged according to the "character function".

    Averaging scheme:
    seeds (average over different randomizations)
        nr of cliffords (peform for different nr of cliffords)
            paulis (perform for different Paulis)
