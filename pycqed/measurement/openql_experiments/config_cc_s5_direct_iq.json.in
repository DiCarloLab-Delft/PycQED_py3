	// notes:


	// The qubits in our setup have the following roles:
	// - D = data
	// - X = ancilla's performing X-type parity checks
	// - Z = idem, Z-type
	//
	// The S-17 layout is shown below, connectivity is between horizontal and vertical neighbors.
	// Based on references:
	// 1) Figure 1 of '1612.08208v1.pdf', rotated by 45 deg
	// 2) 'S17 design considerations_for_Xiang.pdf', renumbered from 0
	//
	// 	-- Z0 D0 -- --
	// 	-- D3 X1 D1 X0
	// 	D6 Z2 D4 Z1 D2
	// 	X3 D7 X2 D5 --
	// 	-- -- D8 Z3 --
	//
	// The frequency assignment of the qubits is (L=low, Mg/My=medium green/yellow, H=high), based on reference 2) :
	// 	-  Mg H  -  -
	// 	-  L  My H  Mg
	// 	H  My L  Mg H
	// 	My H  Mg L  -
	// 	-  -  H  My -
	//
    // FIXME: new numbering instead of above
    // We use the following qubit numbering scheme with *(x,y) coordinates as shown:
    //
    //   x  0  1  2  3  4
    // y ----------------
    // 0 |  -  0  1  -  -
    // 1 |  -  2  3  4  5
    // 2 |  6  7  8  9 10
    // 3 | 11 12 13 14 -
    // 4 |  -  - 15 16 -
    //
    // - data quits have even numbers
    // - qubit at (x,y) is connected to those at (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1), (x,y+1) (insofar present)
    //
    //  Combining the above (and taking the feed lines from reference 2), we arrive at the following table
    //
    //  qubit   name        Freq        feed line
    //  ----------------------------------------
