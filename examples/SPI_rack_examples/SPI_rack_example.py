"""
This is an example on how to control the SPI rack current sources (S4g) using
the FluxCurrent driver of PycQED.

The FluxCurrent driver combines several SPI modules into a single driver
and contains a crosstalk correction matrix.

This example will go over how to install the requirements and show how
to have basic control over the instrument.


1. Ensure the spirack dependencies are installed correctly.
    If on windows, download https://github.com/Rubenknex/SPI-rack and install
        the drivers.zip
    use `pip install spirack` to install the python drivers

2. Run the examples below to ensure everything is working correctly, the
    comments should make this self explanatory.
