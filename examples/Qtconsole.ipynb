    "* New line in same cell: `ctrl`+`enter`\n",

    "* Remove line under the cursor: `ctrl`+`u`\n",
    "* Clear all lines on current cell: `esc`\n",
    "* You can safely paste with `ctrl`+`v` (even with multiline), **paste** and **%paste** do not work and there is no need for them\n",
    "* To execute current cell with multiples lines: `enter` (or you might need `shift`+`enter`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known issues\n",
    "* `q` and `f` to interrupt MC experiments does not work (yet), use `ctrl`+`c` if you need to stop the experiment, this raises a `KeyboardInterrupt`, not known if this can cause any issues (e.g. corrupted datafiles)\n",
    "* Mind that `ctrl`+`c` works as `KeyboardInterrupt`, use the mouse to copy when the experiment is running (or always and stay safe)\n"
